## [2.0.0](https://github.com/maxsokolov/TableKit/releases/tag/2.0.0)
Released on 2016-10-06. Breaking changes in 2.0.0:
<br/>The signatures of `TableRow` and `TableRowAction` classes were changed from
```swift
let action = TableRowAction<String, StringTableViewCell>(.click) { (data) in
}

let row = TableRow<String, StringTableViewCell>(item: "some string", actions: [action])
```
to
```swift
let action = TableRowAction<StringTableViewCell>(.click) { (data) in
}

let row = TableRow<StringTableViewCell>(item: "some string", actions: [action])
```
